Instructions and Reminders:
1. You can either inout expressions with or without white spaces.
2. The precedence of (), [], {} are the same according to the valid input examples and answers from piazza. The expression in the innermost parentheses will calculate first.
3. The calculation of log in my program refers to natural log not log base 10.
4. When calculating the factorial(!), it only works for positive integers. If you enter a negative number or decimal it report to you.
5. I use four symbols to represent log, sin, cos and tangent for the convenience. Here is a list:
	sin: #
	cos: ~
	tan: &
	log: β
     However, you don’t need to input those special symbols in the console. You can’t just type sin90 or cos(3+4). My program will automatically convert all the sin, cos, tan and log. Make sure they are all lower case.
6. When calculating for sin, cos and tan, I made it assumed that the input is in radians not in degrees.
7. Enter a name of a defined variable then press enter, it will return the value of that specific variable if it is defined.

Possible Extra Credit:
1. I include calculation of power, such as input 3^2 and return 9.
2. I include sin, cos and tan operations.
3. I include factorial operations.
4. I include natural log operations.
5. Able to handle borderline expressions such as -(4+2), -(5+2-1), etc.

Thanks for your time!!!O(∩_∩)O
